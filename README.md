# My Personal Website

### Description 
I created this website to simply showcase my other projects and social media links, I ended up making a more intense website then I originally planned for. I added a reactive scroll feature that highlights the page you are currently viewing, a menu that can filter the different skills I have, and a interactive map API. I chose to use React as I was planning on making a one page website with different scroll sections where I could utilize Reacts reausable components. I also used Formspark for collecting the form data, in the future I will add a back-end or a front end solution with Zapier.

### Still in Progress
- Making mobile friendly
- adding a seperate page for the rest of my smaller projects
- Remove the use of formspark and implement backend
