                &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong className='boldedRed'>Iâ€™ve had a interesting journey to get me where I am today.</strong> I studied mechanical engineering and worked in the field for 2 years before making my first career change. I took courses in <strong className='boldedRed'>product managment and UX/UI design</strong> trying to build up my skills and eventually find a job that would satisfy my creative side. I landed a marketing position at a startup. Luckily for me, they also gave me a small role working on the front end (some UI and Blog work), I had basic experience with coding from courses I took in university.

                <br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; This small role sparked my interest in becoming a dev. It had a perfect balance of creative AND technical work (which I missed). 

                <br/>
                <br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp;Since then I have been a freelance Javascript developer. Working mostly <strong className='boldedRed'>Front-end work (HTML, CSS, JS)</strong> for small startups. I also have some experience working with the <strong className='boldedRed'>PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node).</strong>
